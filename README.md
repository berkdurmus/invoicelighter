## Introduction
Invoice Lighter is invoice approval workflow application. It includes both frontend and backend. Frontend is written in React + Vite + Typescript, Backend is written with Node + Typescript. Followed fully OOP structure in Typescript where we have factory pattern, classes, interfaces etc. 

## DB Schema
**Entities and Their Attributes**

## DB Design
For smaller applications, the entire workflow could indeed be managed in-memory using this schema as a guide. In a production environment, a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL would be well-suited to handle this relational structure.
Using JSON for storing parameters allows the schema to handle dynamic configurations without altering the database schema for every rule or action change.
